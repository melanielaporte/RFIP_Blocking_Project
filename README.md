## Overview

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) blocking systems are used to prevent unauthorized access to RFID-enabled devices or systems. This project utilizes an Arduino microcontroller and an RFID reader module to detect RFID tags or cards. When an unauthorized RFID tag is detected, the system triggers a blocking mechanism to prevent access.

## Hardware Components

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- RFID reader module (e.g., MFRC522)
- RFID tags or cards
- LEDs (optional, for indicating RFID detection)
- Resistors and wires for connections

## Software Components

- Arduino Sketch (Code)
- RFID Library (to interface with the RFID reader module)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Arduino IDE**: Download and install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. **Install RFID Library**: Open the Arduino IDE, navigate to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`, search for "MFRC522", and install the library developed by GitHub user miguelbalboa.

3. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the Arduino board to the RFID reader module and any additional components (LEDs, resistors) according to the wiring diagram provided in the project documentation.

4. **Upload Code**: Open the Arduino Sketch provided in this repository in the Arduino IDE, select the appropriate board and port, and upload the code to the Arduino.

5. **Test System**: Power up the Arduino and test the RFID blocking system with RFID tags or cards. Ensure that unauthorized RFID access is blocked as expected.

## Usage

1. Power up the RFID blocking system by connecting the Arduino to a power source.

2. When an RFID tag or card is detected by the system, it will trigger the blocking mechanism to prevent unauthorized access.

3. Monitor the system output via the Arduino IDE serial monitor or any other connected output devices (LEDs, display).
